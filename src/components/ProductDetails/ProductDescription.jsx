        <p>Kasundi is a protein-rich, spicy relish made from mustard seeds. A condiment  and a taste-enhancer. Kasundi brings out the best taste in whatever it is paired up with: seasonal green fruits, snacks such as “shingara” & “pakora”. A recent use of this condiment is in the preparation of “Shorshe Ilish”- famous traditional recipe in the Bengali cuisine & even as salad dressings. A dash of Radhuni Kasundi with any food will leave your taste buds tingling with joy.</p>
